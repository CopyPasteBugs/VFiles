	<!-- Here you can change an old node class to a new class and also reconnect edges to new ports, by remapping old ports to new ones
		 Optionally you can also remap the value of an old input port to an new one, when the port name has changed
		 Also, you can set the input port values of the new node to reasonable/appropriate values
